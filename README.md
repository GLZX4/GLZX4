### Hey there, I'm George 🎸

Welcome to my GitHub corner! I'm a student at the University of Chester, knee-deep in software engineering, with a huge side passion for all things motorsports and crafting models. Here's a bit about me:

- 🔭 Currently sharpening my skills in C++, Java, and diving into Full Stack Development. I'm all about merging tech with the thrill of racing.
- 🌱 On a journey to master ASP.NET, MySQL, and dabbling in R, because why not? Always learning, always growing.
- 👯 Looking to team up on cool projects, especially if they combine tech and fast cars.
- 💬 Got questions about tech, motorsports, or why I think model making is the coolest? Hit me up!

- 😄 Pronouns: He/Him
- ⚡ Fun fact: When I'm not coding, you'll find me karting, sim-racing, or getting messy with watercolours and model kits.

#### What I'm Diving Into 🌊
Getting my hands dirty with ASP.NET and MySQL, and poking around R for the fun of it.
